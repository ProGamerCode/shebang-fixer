# Shebang Fixer

This is a tool that will rewrite the shebangs for a host of files. Useful if
you build virtualenvs in one place but want them to eventually live in another
place.

## Usage

Say you have a virtualenv in `/mnt/packages/foo/bar/env` and you want it to
eventually live at `/usr/local/my-package/env`. Run:

    python fix_shebangs.py current-venv-location new-venv-location

So in our example:

    python fix_shebangs.py /mnt/packages/foo/bar/env /usr/local/my-package/env


This will rewrite every file location in the virtualenv to refer to the new
location.

## Install

Clone this repo and copy the file to your location of choice. It should be
compatible with Python 2.6 and up.
